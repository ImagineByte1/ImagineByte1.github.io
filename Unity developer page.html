                    I am an enthusiastic Game Developer with four years of experience working with Unity and C#.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I specialize in creating engaging game mechanics, levels, and user interfaces that enhance the player's experience. 
                    Throughout my career, I have been involved in all stages of development, from initial concept and design to optimization and release.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I successfully developed a mobile game with over 1,000 lines of optimized and structured code, which allowed me to refine 
                    my skills in programming, optimization, and using Unityâ€™s tools to create seamless and interactive gameplay.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am proficient in the entire game development process, including planning, implementation, balancing, and final tweaks. 
                    My expertise extends to graphic editors and office software, which I use regularly for asset creation and documentation 
                    management.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With my experience and technical skills, I am comfortable working with diverse teams and quickly adapting to new tools 
                    and environments.
