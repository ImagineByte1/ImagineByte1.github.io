                    I am an enthusiastic Game Developer with four years of experience working with Unity and C#.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I specialize in creating engaging game mechanics, levels, and user interfaces that enhance the player's experience. 
                    Throughout my career, I have been involved in all stages of development, from initial concept and design to optimization and release.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I successfully developed a mobile game with over 1,000 lines of optimized and structured code, which allowed me to refine 
                    my skills in programming, optimization, and using Unity’s tools to create seamless and interactive gameplay.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am proficient in the entire game development process, including planning, implementation, balancing, and final tweaks. 
                    My expertise extends to graphic editors and office software, which I use regularly for asset creation and documentation 
                    management.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With my experience and technical skills, I am comfortable working with diverse teams and quickly adapting to new tools 
                    and environments.

                    If I have an idea, then I need to create a Design Document. This document will outline the concept, gameplay mechanics,
                    level design, art style, and any technical details needed for the game development process.

                    <br>
                    Before developing a full game, I create a prototype to test the core mechanics and gameplay loop. 
                    This helps to validate the idea and make necessary adjustments early.

                    <br>
                    Once the prototype is done, it needs to be tested to ensure the gameplay mechanics work as expected.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Marty Mountain Climber is a retro-style 3D platformer inspired by the Nintendo classic Ice Climber, 
                    but with a modern reinterpretation. The game features voxel-based 3D graphics, delivering a nostalgic 
                    yet fresh look, while the pixel-art UI enhances the retro aesthetic.
