                    I am an enthusiastic Game Developer with four years of experience working with Unity and C#.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I specialize in creating engaging game mechanics, levels, and user interfaces that enhance the player's experience. 
                    Throughout my career, I have been involved in all stages of development, from initial concept and design to optimization and release.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I successfully developed a mobile game with over 1,000 lines of optimized and structured code, which allowed me to refine 
                    my skills in programming, optimization, and using Unity’s tools to create seamless and interactive gameplay.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am proficient in the entire game development process, including planning, implementation, balancing, and final tweaks. 
                    My expertise extends to graphic editors and office software, which I use regularly for asset creation and documentation 
                    management.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With my experience and technical skills, I am comfortable working with diverse teams and quickly adapting to new tools 
                    and environments.

                    If I have an idea, then I need to create a Design Document. This document will outline the concept, gameplay mechanics,
                    level design, art style, and any technical details needed for the game development process.

                    <br>
                    Before developing a full game, I create a prototype to test the core mechanics and gameplay loop. 
                    This helps to validate the idea and make necessary adjustments early.

                    <br>
                    Once the prototype is done, it needs to be tested to ensure the gameplay mechanics work as expected.

                    improving controls, and adding basic assets.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At first glance, the game may seem simple, but its visual style is deceptive. 
                    The game features a unique Dynamic Town system that makes every session unique.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="Big_Text">What is this system?</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The system consists of two main parts, which preload all necessary assets when the scene is loaded and then use them dynamically.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    • The first part – background generation The background system is responsible for the city streets, which consist of randomly selected elements. This creates the effect of a constantly changing city, making each run unique.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    • The second part – foreground generation The foreground contains the player, obstacles, and bonuses. 
                    This part of the system is further divided into two subsystems:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    • Main gameplay – responsible for spawning obstacles, placing platforms, and controlling player behavior.
                    <br>
                    • Mini-games with gadgets – activated when using special items and adding variety to the gameplay.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="Big_Text">Optimization and Object Management</span> 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Instead of constantly creating new objects for each part of the scene, the system uses existing ones. 
                    Each object moves across the scene and is activated when it enters the player's view. When an object goes off-screen, 
                    it is deactivated and returned to its starting position for the next use.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This optimizes the game's performance and avoids constant frame rate spikes, as the system does not create new 
                    objects unnecessarily but simply reuses existing ones. This reduces the load on the processor and graphics, 
                    maintaining a stable frame rate.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="Big_Text">How the object selection and game dynamics work?</span> 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In Marty On The Run, each obstacle has its own tag, which associates it with a certain object layer. This allows for varying the speed, sounds, and behavior of objects depending on their category.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Layers help define the general category of the object, and the tags then determine individual settings, such as speed and sound randomizers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    • Individual speed: Over time, the speed of objects gradually increases according to their initial speed. 
                    This creates growing intensity and challenge for the player, as objects become faster and more unpredictable.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    • Sound randomizers: Each object has a unique sound, adding variety and realism by mimicking different motor 
                    sounds or other noise effects in the Town.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This system ensures dynamic and adaptive gameplay, where objects are constantly changing, creating new challenges for the player.

                    Marty Mountain Climber is a retro-style 3D platformer inspired by the Nintendo classic Ice Climber, 
                    but with a modern reinterpretation. The game features voxel-based 3D graphics, delivering a nostalgic 
                    yet fresh look, while the pixel-art UI enhances the retro aesthetic.
